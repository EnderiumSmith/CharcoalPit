jei.charcoal_pit.name=To make a charcoal pit place log piles in any shape you want then cover any exposed piles with non-flammable solid blocks.\nTo start it light one of the log piles on fire then quickly cover it. Its working if you see smoke particles at the top. Creosote oil can be collected during the process using creosote funnels.\nIf the structure is invalid the log piles will burn like regular blocks, cascading to neighboring piles.\nAfter a while (18MC hours by default) the pit will stop smoking and the log piles will turn into an ash-looking block. Digging that block up will result in charcoal and ash in a 1:1 ratio (by default). Furtune can be used to improve your charcoal gains.\nCreosote oil can be collected during the process using creosote funnels.

jei.coke_oven.name=To make a coke oven place coal blocks in any shape you want then cover any exposed blocks with non-flammable solid blocks that qualify as refractory materials (brick and nether brick by default).\nTo start it light one of the coal blocks on fire then quickly cover it. Its working if you see smoke particles at the top. Creosote oil can be collected during the process using creosote funnels.\nIf the structure is invalid the coal blocks will burn like regular blocks, cascading to neighboring coals.\nAfter a while (36MC hours by default) the oven will stop smoking and the coal blocks will turn into an ash-looking block. Digging that block up will result in coal coke and ash in a 4:1 ratio (by default). Furtune can be used to improve your coke gains.

jei.pottery_kiln.name=To make a pottery kiln shift-right-click an ingredient on the tops of a solid block. The ingredient will be placed on the ground forming a kiln. Then cover the kiln (by default) with a hale of bay and 3 logs of wood.\nThe kiln needs to be covered with solid blocks on all sides except the top which needs to be empty. When it's ready light the top on fire then wait. If the structure is invalid or it's being rained on the fire will go out.\nAfter a while (8MC hours by default) the kiln will turn into an ash-looking block. Dig it up to get pottery and some ash.\nA dispenser can also build the kiln. Removing the block below the kiln will break it.
